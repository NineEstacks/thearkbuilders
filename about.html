                        withing our reach, because God's will  is to "have all men to be saved, and to come

                        We believe every soul in the world is loved. We are created with a purpose. We are not just 
                        the product of our parents. We are created uniquely and with intention. God lovingly designed 
                        every detail of our being.

                        <p>
                        The Church is a sign and instrument of communion with God and of unity among all men and women 
                        who are called to bring the joy of the Gospel to the whole world. "Now therefore ye are no more 
                        strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;"

                            The Kingdom of God has its own culture. Our desire as a church is to define more clearly God’s call 
                            for our body to emulate heaven by being a racially and ethnically diverse people that live out Kingdom 
                            Culture as a unified body. A “Kingdom Culture" Church is a Spirit-led, biblically based family of God 
                            embracing every nation, tribe, people and language, committed to worshiping Jesus and living out Kingdom 
                            values in community. We are for Jesus Christ, His Church and His mission to the world.

                        <p>
                        The Christian life is NOT a list of rules and formulas. It is a personal walk with the living 
                        God. We need to be Spirit led. We are committed to engaging culture from a biblical worldview; therefore, our mission is not to
                        align to any specific person, social trend, political party or organization but to challenge 
                        everyone in all spheres of society to live as disciples of Jesus and to apply biblical 
                        conviction in their leadership and influence.
                        "But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. For the desires of the 
                        flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed 
                        to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do." Galatians 5:16-17.

                        We believe <strong>the Bible </strong> to be the inspired, the only infallible, and authoritative Word of God.
                        "And we also thank God continually because, when you received the word of God, which you heard 
                        from us, you accepted it not as a human word, but as it actually is, the word of God, 
                        which is indeed at work in you who believe." 1 Thessalonians 2:13
                        <br>"You have been taught the holy Scriptures from childhood, and they have given you the wisdom to 
                        receive the salvation that comes by trusting in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is inspired by God 
                        and is useful to teach us what is true and to make us realize what is wrong in our lives."

                            We believe in one eternal God who is the Creator of all things, eternally existent in three 
                            persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. <br>
                            "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of <strong> 
                            the Father</strong> and of <strong>the Son</strong> and of <strong>the Holy Spirit</strong>"
                            Matthew 28:19. <br> The Godhead is the essence of the Divine Being; the Godhead is the one and only Deity.
                            "Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that <strong>the Godhead</strong> is like unto gold, 
                            or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device" (Acts 17:29).

                        <h6>The Atonement</h6>
                        <p>
                        We believe that through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved. In Christianity, atonement 
                        refers to the needed reconciliation between sinful mankind and the holy God. This reconciliation 
                        is possible through the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Atonement is the Bible’s central message. To
                        atone is to suffer the penalty for sins, thereby removing the effects of sin from the repentant sinner and 
                        allowing him or her to be reconciled to God. Jesus Christ was the only one capable of carrying 
                        out the Atonement for all mankind. “Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall 
                        be saved from wrath through him. For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the 
                        death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. And not only so, 
                        but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the 
                        atonement.” (Romans 5:9-11)
                        </p>

                    <div class="column block-list__item">
                        <h6>The Second Coming</h6>
                        <p>
                        As Jesus Christ ascended into heaven at the completion of His mortal ministry, two angels 
                        declared to His Apostles, “This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so 
                        come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven” (Acts 1:11). Since that time, believers 
                        have looked forward to the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. When the Savior comes again, He will 
                        come in power and glory to claim the earth as His kingdom. The Second Coming will be a fearful, 
                        mournful time for the wicked, but it will be a day of peace for the righteous. <br>
                        When Jesus Christ was born, very few people knew that the Savior of the world had come. When He 
                        comes again, there will be no doubt who He is. No one knows the exact time that the Savior will 
                        come again. “Of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my 
                        Father only” (Matthew 24:36).
                        </p>
